notes on timings..

 - measure DB time, both v$stat and v$time_model.
 - measure python time via perfcounter_ns
 - measure ping: ping-time minus empty-loop-time.. => RT Time (any db time involved?)
 - measure commit-time : just do 1000 ins-commit and 1000 del-commits.. ?  repeat without commit..
 - measure db-time from spinf_n ( 10.0 )  ? 
 - measure pyytong tiome from 10sec spin.. ? 


RT sampling:
 - 1000 ping, measure time, calc avg (subtract empty-loop-time ? )
 - 1000 records from dual with prefetch 0 and array=1 : 100 RTs

Bundle all in a few functions: benchmark-python-oracle..:
  - report RT time (from python-db-ping)
  - report Commit-time.

use table : tst_py_42 ( id number )  : 
light weight table, ins-1000 and del-1000 with + without commit.


todo: 
 - log sql_history and report heavy stmnts..,
 - compare to ASH ? 


sql_history:_h
 - create table xx_sql_hst : mk_sql_hist.sql
 - create function to store session-data in tbl : mk_sql_hist.sql
 - call the function to store data ( from sql or from python)
 - output readable data from python : ora_login.py :  ora_sess_report()
    needs if-smnt for presence of the function ? 
 - later: exclude the internal SQL, to keep cleaner data ?
 - compare to AWR ?
